# Handoff — orchestration seed (Wave 3 wrap-up → Wave 4)

This is a **planning seed for an orchestrator**, not a single-task brief.
It gives the next driver the *truth on the ground*, the dependency map for
what's left, and the parallel/serial split — not a linear to-do list. Read
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) (task graph + channel rules) alongside
it, and [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) before validating anything.

## TL;DR

The port is **functionally complete for the single-device live use case**.
Waves 1–3 landed and merged: the full input→router→output pipeline, the
config/page action system (8 action tiers incl. HID + tap-tempo + cycles +
radio groups), the settings menu, the on-device config editor, the
chromatic tuner (MIDI-fed), flash persistence, and a USB-CDC config-sync
link. What remains is a short tail of **integration glue** (one channel
not yet routed), two **hardware-gated** features (audio-DSP tuner, PWM
backlight), and a **cross-branch webapp** effort whose firmware side is
already done. Details below.

## Branch / PR policy — **CHANGED, read this**

The old invariant said "target `SAFE_main`, never `main`." **That no longer
holds.** `SAFE_main` was merged into `main` (commit `cbe0841`,
*"Merge SAFE_main -> main: refresh firmware to the current Rust port"*) and
every feature PR since (#15–#45) has merged to **`main`**. `SAFE_main`
still exists as a branch but is now **legacy and one commit behind `main`**.

- **Target `main`.** It is the single integration branch now.
- The repo is a fork of `nicola-lunghi/hiper-midicaptain`; `gh pr create`
  defaults the base to the *upstream*. Always pass
  `-R mycosavant/midicaptain_remedy --base main` and verify
  `isCrossRepository=false`.
- Develop on a feature branch, one subsystem per PR, open ready-for-review.

## What's landed (truth as of `90fd7d5`)

Everything below is merged to `main`, builds clean, and (except where
noted) has an on-device or self-test proof. File references are the

## What's pending — the remaining trajectory

The router in `src/app.rs` is the **shared integration surface**.
Everything here is either an *independent module* (new file, feeds the
router through a channel — **parallelisable**) or *integrative* work that
edits the router/app state (**serialise it**). Keep new work in **new
files**; use `isolation: "worktree"` for any agent that must touch shared
files concurrently.

### ▸ Foundation glue (serial — do first; unblocks device sync)

**Route `SYSEX_IN` into the router.** The SysEx-in channel is produced but
**never consumed** — incoming Roland/Katana SysEx is silently dropped.
- Today the router selects `select(select4(buttons, encoder, expr,
  midi_rx), config_req)` — see `src/app.rs:1054-1074`. `SYSEX_IN` is
  created and fed by `usb_in_loop`/`din_in_loop` (`src/bin/midicaptain.rs:90,333,338`)
  but is not one of those arms.
- Add it as a third top-level `select` arm (e.g.
  `select3(select4(...), config_req.receive(), sysex_in.receive())`) and a
  `Router::on_sysex_rx` handler. This is small but it edits the router, so
  it's **serial** — land it before, or as the first commit of, device sync.

### ▸ Device sync (independent parser + serial integration)

Query the Katana for current effect state on boot/connect and reflect it on
the toggle LEDs. Two halves:
1. **Katana DT1 *response* parser** — `src/midi/katana.rs` has all the
   *builders* (`dt1`, `rq1`, `enter_editor_mode`, per-block setters) but
   **no parser** for *incoming* `F0 41 <dev> <model> 12 <addr[4]>
   <data..> <cksum> F7` messages. Add `parse_dt1(&[u8]) -> Option<(addr,
   data)>` with checksum verification. **Independent, new code, unit/self-
   testable** — follow the `midi_engine_test` pattern. *Parallelisable.*
2. **RQ1 boot sweep + LED reflection** — on boot (gated by a
   `query_device` config flag), emit `rq1(...)` for the tracked blocks;
   route the DT1 responses (via the SYSEX_IN wiring above) into the
   router's toggle/LED state. **Serial** (edits the router).

Model both as a self-contained subsystem like menu/tuner did: parser +
data in `katana.rs`, integration in `app.rs`.

### ▸ Tuner Phase 3 — on-device audio DSP (**hardware-gated**)

The shipped tuner is MIDI-fed, but **the Katana broadcasts nothing over
MIDI for tuning** (documented dead-end — see `git log` for the 2026-05-30
finding). The chosen path is **standalone on-device pitch detection**:
- `src/pitch.rs` (YIN, fixed-point) is **done and self-tested**.
- The analog front-end spec (line-out → AC-couple → mid-rail bias →
  rail-to-rail buffer → ~3.5 kHz anti-alias LPF → GP26/ADC0) is in
  `HARDWARE.md`. **GP26 is free** (`src/pins.rs:148`).
- **Pending:** an `adc_task` that DMA-samples GP26 at ~16 kHz *in
  `Mode::Tuner`*, runs `PitchDetector::detect`, and feeds `TunerView`.
  The ADC is currently owned by `expression_task` — Phase 3 must
  share/duplex it (audio in tuner mode, pedals otherwise).
- **Blocker:** needs the hardware mod to validate. The task can be *written*
  against the spec, but don't claim it works until it's been on real
  silicon with the front-end fitted. Keep the MIDI-receive path too (free
  remote-display fallback from host software).

### ▸ Display brightness — PWM backlight (small, shared file)

`src/display.rs:114-116` drives the backlight plain GPIO-high; the comment
flags the intended `PWMOut` wrapper. The settings menu already *defers* a
"Display Brightness" item waiting on this. Wrap the backlight pin in a PWM
slice, expose a brightness setter, wire the menu item + persist to flash.
Touches shared `display.rs` — keep it its own PR.

### ▸ Webapp live-config sync (**cross-branch — already in flight as PR #31**)

The firmware side is done (CDC GET/SET, `proto.rs`). **PR #31** (open,
webapp-only) adds a Web Serial live-config editor under `webapp/`.
- **⚠️ Currency gap, bigger than the PR's own note says.** PR #31 was cut
  2026-05-31 mirroring an early wire format. Since then the firmware's
  `PROTO_VERSION` has reached **8** and `RuntimeConfig` has grown
  (`midi_thru`, `cycles`, appended fields — `src/config/mod.rs:815-898`).
  Before #31 can talk to current firmware its JS codec
  (`webapp/js/device/{postcard,runtimeconfig}.js`) must be re-synced to the
  *current* `config::RuntimeConfig` and accept proto v8. Treat this as a
  required follow-up, not a nit.
- Real end-to-end bench test (Chromium → device CDC → read/tweak/write →
  confirm via RTT) is still pending — #31 was built without a device.
- This is a genuine **cross-branch effort** (firmware config model ⇄ JS
  codec must stay in lockstep). Whenever `config::RuntimeConfig` or
  `PROTO_VERSION` changes, the webapp codec is part of the same change.

## Recommended sequence

1. **`SYSEX_IN` → router** (serial foundation).
2. **Device sync** — DT1 parser (parallel) then RQ1 sweep + LED reflection
   (serial). This is the clear next *firmware* subsystem.
3. **PWM backlight** + the deferred menu item (independent PR).
4. **Webapp #31 currency pass** — re-sync the JS codec to proto v8 /
   current `RuntimeConfig`, then bench-test.
5. **Tuner Phase 3** — only once the analog front-end hardware mod exists.

Items 2–4 are largely independent and can run as parallel sessions /
subagents *as long as* each keeps to its own files and integration into the
router stays serial (one PR at a time touching `app.rs`).

## Invariants (do not violate)

- **Target `main`** (see policy section above). One subsystem per PR,
  ready-for-review, `isCrossRepository=false`.
- **Firmware work stays in `firmware/`.** Don't modify `../remedy/`,
  `../webapp/` (except the dedicated webapp effort), `../MIDICAPTAIN_OEM_BACKUP/`,
  `../presets/`, or the root `../CLAUDE.md`. `../remedy/lib/` is the
  behavioural reference, read-only.
- **No USB MSC.** The device owns its flash exclusively; host sync rides
  USB-CDC.
- **Commit `Cargo.lock`.** Do **not** commit the `.cargo/config.toml`
  runner flip (probe-rs alt runner is a local, uncommitted change so
  probe-less contributors stay on UF2).
- **Green gate before pushing:**
  `cargo build --release --bins --examples` **and**
  `cargo clippy --release --lib --bins --examples -- -D warnings`.

## Gotchas still live

- **embassy-executor 0.10 spawn idiom:** `spawner.spawn(task(args).unwrap())`
  (the `#[task]` call yields a `Result`; unwrap to the token). No
  `must_spawn`.
- **mipidsi 0.10 ≠ CircuitPython conventions:** offset is constant across
  rotation; this panel needs **colour inversion ON**. Documented in the
  `display.rs` header — don't "fix" it back to the CP numbers.
- **Channels need a `RawMutex`:** `CriticalSectionRawMutex` + a `const`
  `static CH: Channel<...> = Channel::new()`. See the bin.
- **`embassy_futures` tops out at `select4`.** Adding a fifth+ input means
  nesting selects (already done once for `config_req`; `SYSEX_IN` makes a
  third arm). Receive futures are cancellation-safe, so the losing branch
  re-arms with no lost messages.
- **USB is a 5-interface composite** (MIDI ×2, CDC ×2, HID ×1) — hence
  `max-interface-count-8` in `Cargo.toml`. Adding another interface eats
  the headroom.
- **Flash buffer sizing:** the settings+config store buffer is sized to the
  *largest* map item (`MAX_SERIALIZED_LEN`); growing `RuntimeConfig` past
  it will silently fail to persist. `storage_coexist_selftest` guards this.
- Older display-driver / bootstrap gotchas: `git log -p firmware/HANDOFF.md`.

## Toolchain reality

- **Build anywhere; flash only from Windows PowerShell** (WSL can't see
  USB; the probe + `probe-rs.exe` live on Windows). `cargo run` uses the
  runner in `.cargo/config.toml` (UF2 default; probe-rs is the local,
  uncommitted alt). Full flashing playbook in `TESTING.md §4`.

## Meta

Keep this file forward-looking: hand the next driver the dependency map and
the parallel/serial split, and let code + commits carry the backward-looking
detail. The foundation is solid and largely validated — what's left is a
short, well-scoped tail. Good luck.
